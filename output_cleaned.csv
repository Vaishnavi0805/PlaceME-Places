Areopagus,Spas,The Areopagus rips is a prominent rock outcropping located northwest of the Acropolis in Athens Greece Its English name is the Late Latin composite form of the Greek name Areios Pagos translated Hill of Ares Ancient Greek x0081  The name Areopagus also referred in classical times to the Athenian governing council later restricted to the Athenian judicial council or court that tried cases of deliberate homicide wounding and religious matters as well as cases involving arson of olive trees because they convened in this location12The war god Ares was supposed to have been tried by the other gods on the Areopagus for the murder of Poseidons son Halirrhothius a typical example of an aetiological mythThe exact origin of the Areopagus is unclear In preclassical times before the 5th century BC the Areopagus may have been a council of elders for the city of Athens and membership was restricted to those who had held high public office in this case that of Archon3 Conversely it may have also begun almost exclusively as a homicide court and judicial body4 While there is no true consensus homicide trials seem to have been held on the Areopagus hill as early as the 7th century BC and possibly as far back as the mid8th century BC5In 594 BC the Areopagus was heavily restructured by Solon as was the rest of the Athenian state Aristotle suggests that he confirmed its competence over cases of treason eisangelia  and its guardianship of the laws nomophylakia 6 Solons entrusting of the nomophylakia to the Areopagus may imply that the council was invested with maintaining the stability of his reforms after he left Athens7Under the reforms of Cleisthenes enacted in 508507 BC the Boule  or council was expanded from  400 to 500 men and was formed of 50 men from each of ten clans or phylai  There is very little evidence to suggest that Cleisthenes may have altered the composition or the jurisdiction of the Areopagus given that he himself was likely a member of the council8,Mumbai,1.0,"""[View] Itâ€™s really a super nice place here, I really like it, itâ€™s a great feeling, itâ€™s really good.""",5//5,https://us.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/mumbai/areopagus-61138457/,['']

The sculptures of the porch and the pillars, the top of the caves, etc. are very exquisite, and even dynamic. [Note] - with flashlight: India's grottoes are relatively large, and the mobile phone light is basically useless - you can take pictures in the cave, please must turn off the flashlight - the murals are so beautiful, how can you bear to hurt them? Let our children have the opportunity to see beauty too! -Some people on duty in the grottoes guard themselves, give a 10 rupee, 20 rupees will remove the sticks blocking the Buddha's temple, let you go in and take pictures casually, personally do not recommend this, love cultural relics, everyone has responsibility - most of the grottoes have to take off their shoes into the inside, it is  to bring thick socks, the gap between the holes is short, Just walk with socks and save shoes. - Shoes off at the door, if not super expensive shoes, everyone is a tourist, no one will steal (at least my friend Nike is no problem). The entrance of the 1st and 2nd caves is because the tourists have just arrived and the viewing time is long, so the shoes are concentrated, and some locals have opened 400 rupees to help us look at the shoes. Fortunately, I refused because I didn't need it at all. -Monkeys are a lot and quick, but more polite than the monkeys of Mount Emei, will not be hard to grab, but the food is better hidden, once seen, will be as tireless as the vendor followed with food.""",4.5//5,https://us.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/mumbai/no-footprints-50591372/,['']

Jami Masjid,Other Places of Worship,A congregational mosque or Friday mosque or sometimes great mosque or grand mosque  is a mosque for hosting the Friday noon prayers known as jumuah1 It can also host the Eid prayers in situations when there is no musalla or eidgah available nearby to host the prayers In early Islamic history the number of congregational mosques in one city was strictly limited As cities and populations grew over time it became more common for many mosques to host Friday prayers in the same area23The full Arabic term for this kind of mosque is masjid which is typically translated as mosque of congregation or congregational mosque2 Congregational is used to translate  which comes from the Arabic root which has a meaning to bring together In Arabic the term is typically simplified to just  Similarly in Turkish the term cami Turkish pronunciationdami is used for the same purpose5 As the distinction between a congregational mosque and other mosques has diminished in more recent history the Arabic terms masjid and jami have become more interchangeableIn nonArab Muslim nations the word that which gathers congregates or assembles is often conflated with another word from the same root jumuah  assembly gathering a term which refers to the Friday noon prayers  romanized prayer of assembly or the Friday itself x008f romanized day of assembly8 This is due to the fact that the jumuah prayers require congregations and are only held in congregational mosques usually the main mosque or central mosque of a town or city and hence they are also sometimes known as Friday mosquesSince the early periods of Islam a functional distinction existed between large central mosques built and controlled by the state versus small local mosques built and maintained by the general population9 In the early years of Islam under the Rashidun caliphs and many of the Umayyad caliphs each city generally had only one congregational mosque where Friday prayers were held while smaller mosques for regular prayers were built in local neighbourhoods In fact in some parts of the Islamic world such as in Egypt Friday services were initially not permitted in villages and in other areas outside the main city where the congregational mosque stood10 The ruler or governor of the city usually built his residence the dar alimara next to the congregational mosque and in this early period the ruler also delivered the khutbah Friday sermon during Friday prayers911 This practice was inherited from the example of Muhammad and was passed on the caliphs after him In the provinces the local governors who ruled on behalf of the caliph were expected to deliver the khutbah for their local community11 The minbar a kind of pulpit from which the khutbah was traditionally given also became a standard feature of congregational mosques by the early Abbasid period late eighth century1213,India Â· Mandav,1.4,,,https://us.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/mandav/jami-masjid-61772452/,['']

Escapology,Escape Rooms,Escapology is the practice of escaping from restraints or other traps Escapologists also classified as escape artists escape from handcuffs straitjackets cages coffins steel boxes barrels bags burning buildings fishtanks and other perils often in combinationThe art of escaping from restraints and confined spaces has been a skill employed by performers for a very long time It was not originally displayed as an overt act in itself but was instead used secretly to create illusions such as a disappearance or transmutation1 In the 1860s the Davenport Brothers who were skilled at releasing themselves from rope ties used the art to convey the impression they were restrained while they created spirit phenomena2Other illusionists including John Nevil Maskelyne worked out how the Davenports did their act and recreated the tricks to debunk the brothers claims of psychic power However the recreations did not involve overt escape merely a replication of tricks with the statement that they were accomplished by secret magicians skills rather than spirits It took another thirty years before the pure skill of escape began to be displayed as an act in itself The figure most responsible for making escapology a recognized entertainment was Harry Houdini who built his career on demonstrating the ability to escape from a huge variety of restraints and difficult situations3Houdini made no secret of the fact that he was an expert on restraints and the skills needed to overcome them but he often concealed the exact details of his escapes to maintain an air of mystery and suspense Although many of his escapes relied on technical skills such as lockpicking and contortion he also performed tricks such as Metamorphosis and the Chinese Water Torture Cell which are essentially classic stage illusions reliant on cleverly designed props Houdinis feats helped to define the basic repertoire of escapology including escapes from handcuffs padlocks straitjackets mail bags4 beer barrels and prison cells,Navi Mumbai,1.0,,,https://us.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/navi-mumbai/escapology-56019221/,['']
